* Light Castle
** Overview
- Light Castle is intended to be a RESTful server/client text-based RPG game, written in Python.

** Source
- The upstream version of the game can be found here [fn:1]. For now, this is my fork. [fn:2]

** Installation
- As of right now (Wed Sep 26 12:35:12 EDT 2012), you can run "python2 rpg.py" to get a random result.
*** TODO Test webserver.py and webapp.py

** Known Bugs
- Wed Sep 26 12:36:57 EDT 2012: When running rpg.py, player always wins, presumably due to an algorithmic error.
